## Shortest path among polygons
This was my project for Geometric algorithms subject at Faculty of Computing. Problem stands. 

Write a program that, given a set of disjoint polygons, a start point p, and an end point q, computes the shortest path between p and q  that does not enter into the interior of any polygon. 
#### Upper bounds: O(n^2log n) time, where n is the total number of edges in the obstacles.

The program is written in python, and general algorithm is from book</br>

## Shortest path among polygons
Solution for Geometric Algorithms course project from Faculty of Computer Science. Detailed problem statement and proposed solution can be found in the book [Computational Geometry - Algorithms and Application](https://people.inf.elte.hu/fekete/algoritmusok_msc/terinfo_geom/konyvek/Computational%20Geometry%20-%20Algorithms%20and%20Applications,%203rd%20Ed.pdf) chapter 15.
## Problem statement
Write a program that, that, given a set of disjoint polygons, a start point p, and an endpoint q, computes the shortest path between p and q  that does not enter into the interior of any polygon. 

**Upper bounds: O(n^2log n) time, where n is the total number of edges in the obstacles.**
